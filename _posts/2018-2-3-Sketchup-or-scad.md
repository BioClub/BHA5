Hello everyone! If you have already seen the video lecture from week one, you know you will need to learn how to 2D CAD and 3D CAD. It may sound hard at first but the right tools will make it a lot easier!

I strongly suggest starting off by buying an Android tablet with stylus support like [this](http://amzn.asia/ezhrla1) and use Autodesk's [AutoCAD](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autodesk.autocadws) app as it will be much easier to make 2D dimentions.

As for 3D CADing, I suggest using Autodesk's [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview). The UI is very simple one you get the hang of it, and there's a lot of tutorials online.

And the best part is: it's free (if you are a student)! Also there's cloud storage and free online rendering for Fusion 360!
