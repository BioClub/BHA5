# Ways of infection
- It is about the pathway of how we get infected.  
The path on the centre shows the organ from our mouth to anus. This way of showing the route of infection 
is very clear and interesting.  
- Explanation of the figure (I might be wrong)  
Outer part(shown in grid)is our outer layer skin, and the inner part(shown in grey)shows our organ and mucus 
on the epidermal part which is inside part of our body.
