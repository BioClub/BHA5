Desired Airflow Rate: 0.5m/sec

Door Size: 41cm x 32cm

0.41 x 0.32 x 0.5 = 0.0656 m<sup>3</sup>/sec

0.0656 * 60 = 3.936 m<sup>3</sup>/min
0.0656 * 60 * 60 = 236.16 m<sup>3</sup>/h

In Japan is different, airflow is usually specified m3/minute. 

Example 120mm [fan](https://www.monotaro.com/g/00347764/).

> Frame mounting angle (mm) 120 <br />
> Frame thickness (mm) 38 Voltage (V) 100 <br />
> Maximum air flow rate (m 3 / min) (50/60 Hz) 2.5 / 2.9 <br />
> Maximum static pressure (Pa) (50/60 Hz) 57.9 / 68.7 <br />

Basically, for a 120mm cooling fan, we get 2.5 m<sup>3</sup>/min (2.9 m<sup>3</sup>/min if you live in Western Japan, as the have there 100V/60Hz, where East Japan is 100V/50Hz.)

So, if we'd use two fans, we'd get 5.0 m<sup>3</sup>/min, which should be enough for this case.
