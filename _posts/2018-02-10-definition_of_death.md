Entropy is a <span style="color : red">visualisation of lifeâ€™s presence slowly leaving the body</span>.<br> 
A thermo-cam image of the body of a dead horse shows its silhouette slowly fade from the screen as its body loses heat until it vanishes entirely.

## about death
Generally, we think death is stopping heat beat.
but she spreads the meaning that death is vanishing heat of body.

I think there is third point of death.
It is death of cell.
I'm interested in when cell is dead?, which part of cell live longest?, how cell will die?
also I'm interested in visualization, death of cell.
That is really last death.
