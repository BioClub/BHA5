Entropy is a <span style="color : red">visualisation of lifeâ€™s presence slowly leaving the body</span>.<br> 
A thermo-cam image of the body of a dead horse shows its silhouette slowly fade from the screen as its body loses heat until it vanishes entirely.<br>

## about death
Generally, we think death is stopping heat beat.<br>
but she spreads the meaning that death is vanishing heart of body.<br>

I think there is third point of death.<br>
It is "<span style="color : red;">death of cell</span>".<br>

I'm interested in when cell will be dead?, which part of cell will live longest?, how cell will die?<br>
also I'm interested in visualization, death of cell.<br>
I think that is <span style="color : red;">really last death</span>.<br>
