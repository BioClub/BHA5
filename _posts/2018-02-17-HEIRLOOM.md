# what is "[HEIRLOOM](https://www.ginaczarnecki.com/heirloom)"?
In Heirloom, Gina Czarnecki <font color="red">grows skin portraits</font> of her daughters from their own cells onto glass casts. <br>
The growing portraits are bathed(浸される) in a liquid that feeds(供給する) them and prevents infection(感染を防ぐ). <br>
When the cells reach the thickness of tissue paper they are <font color="red">removed, preserved, and displayed</font> as framed portraits.<br>

# motivation
The starting point of Heirloom was the idea of <font color="red">having your teenage face back in the future</font>.<br>

# system (how to make?)
<img src="/images/heirloom_02.png" width="500px">

1. Cast (make a 3D templete of your face)   // 鋳る<br>
2. <font color="red">Grow</font> (sample your cells and grow over the templete)<br>
3. <font color="red">Apply</font> (preserve the skin or integrate back into your body)   // preserve : 保存する<br>
4. Bank (archive your appearance along with your cells)   // appearance : 外観<br>
5. Scan (Back up your face today, for future repetitions)   // repetitions : 反復<br>

# future vision : facial reconstruction
The methods developed could offer <font color="red">new possibilities for facial reconstruction and cosmetic modification</font>.
if biobanks stored information about the 3D structure of the face along with youthful skin cells, could everyone have their own facial heirloom?

# point of my view
- interesting point
  - 今の細胞をベースに育てて、別の形を作るところ。
  - アウトプットの美しさ。細胞培養の、シリコン的な素材。
