### About Me
- who are you? 
  - I'm Jun Nishimura from Japan.
- what I'm interested in
  - gender/sexuality/erotics
  

- the reason I joined the biohack academy<br>
I'm originally interested in art, specifically erotic art. I was thinking that the application of the bio technologies should be discussed within not only scientists but also general people. Then I found the bio community in Japan named bioClub, and then I knew this biohack academy. I don't have biology background, so I thought this would be a good chance to expose myself into the world of biology.

#### the short description of the project
- I have been thinking what the death is and when the death comes. I think that the death in terms of the biological definition is not the true meaning of the death. we, living things, can live based on the system of the food chain.　we, living things, can live under the sacrifice of the other animals. I think those sacrifices are not death. when I think about the death which i defined, the death happen if the thing is removed from that relationship, which is to say, treating as garbage.
i had a doubt against the way to treat the sperm. after people have sex, except for the case of trying to have a baby, those sperms are treated as the garbage and thrown away to the trush bin. thus I thought I wanted to make an work with sperm.
I got an inspiration from the melting way of candles which sacrifice themselves to brightn and make warm. By making a candle mixing the sperm, I express that we are living on something sacrificed. by looking at the melting process of that candle, we might get the differenct views toward the death.

title : never die
short description : I make a candle mixing with sperm to express the infinity of the life. I wanted to give others the chance to think about the death from the different view.
