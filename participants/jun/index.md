### About Me
- who are you? 
  - I'm Jun Nishimura from Japan.
- what I'm interested in
  - gender/sexuality/erotics
  

- the reason I joined the biohack academy<br>
I'm originally interested in art, specifically erotic art. I was thinking that the application of the bio technologies should be discussed within not only scientists but also general people. Then I found the bio community in Japan named bioClub, and then I knew this biohack academy. I don't have biology background, so I thought this would be a good chance to expose myself into the world of biology.

#### the short description of the project
- I have been thinking what the death is and when the death comes. I think that the death in terms of the biological definition is not the true meaning of the death. 生命は場所や時代を超えて、相互的に影響を及ぼし合っている。ゴミとして扱い、その相互関係から除外することこそ、死なのかもしれない。生命の誕生に欠かすことのできない精子だが、使用済みの精子はしばしば不必要なゴミとして扱われることに疑問をもち、精子を使った作品を作りたい思った。自己を犠牲にすることで周りを明るくし、暖かさを作りだすキャンドルの姿に、
