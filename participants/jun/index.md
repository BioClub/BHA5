- the reason I joined the biohack academy<br>
I'm originally interested in art, specifically erotic art. I was thinking that the application of the bio technologies should be discussed within not only scientists but also general people. Then I found the bio community in Japan named bioClub, and then I knew this biohack academy. I don't have biology background, so I thought this would be a good chance to expose myself into the world of biology.
